 Box plot of age of customer by gender 
 
In the above figure, it is demostrated that on average the male customers are older than the 
female customer. With the female customer on average being in their forties and the male 
customers are in their fifties. This insight os quite significant as stakeholders in the 
customer experience team can use this detial and reach out to older customers especially, 
giving them training on how to spot fraudulent transactions there by curbing the risk of them 
falling victim to scam.

Pie chart showing the spend range and total fraudulent amount.

Our earlier analysis showed that the average amount spent on any transaction by a customer, 
either female or male was $71,  which is a characteristic of fraudulent transactions, the observation is that fraudulent transactions tend to be three times 
or higher the average spend of a customer. This makes sense as scammers would want to cash 
in big in order to get away with as much more as they can.
