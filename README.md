# Key Contributions
## 1. Development and Calculation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 📊
I designed and executed SQL queries to calculate core retail KPIs, including total sales, net sales, transaction volumes, and units sold. By aggregating transactional data across products, customers, stores, and sales channels, I enabled a consistent and accurate measurement of business performance. These KPIs form the foundation for monitoring revenue trends and evaluating overall commercial health.

## 2. Transformation of Raw Transactional Data into Actionable Insights 🔍
I applied SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, and conditional logic to convert underutilised raw data into meaningful analytical outputs. This included analysing discounted versus non-discounted sales, identifying top-performing stores and regions, and assessing product category performance. These analyses provided clear, data-driven insights to support operational and strategic decision-making.

## 3. Customer Segmentation and Behavioural Analysis 👥
I conducted customer-level analysis to evaluate spending behaviour, purchase frequency, and the relative contribution of VIP and Regular customers. By linking sales and customer data, I identified high-value and repeat customers, supporting a deeper understanding of loyalty and customer value. This contribution enables more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer retention initiatives.

## 4. Product, Store, and Channel Performance Evaluation 🛍️📍
I analysed performance trends across product categories, stores, regions, and sales channels to identify areas of strength and underperformance. This included assessing which categories perform best, which locations drive the highest sales, and which channels generate the most revenue. These insights support more effective inventory management, channel optimisation, and resource allocation.

## 5. Translation of SQL Analysis into Business-Focused Recommendations 🚀
Beyond technical query development, I translated SQL outputs into clear, business-relevant insights aligned with Aurelia Styles’ strategic objectives. This ensured that analytical findings could be readily used to inform decisions on inventory planning, promotional effectiveness, customer engagement, and overall business growth.

# Dashboard Reporting
## Product Performance Analysis
Deskify’s product performance shows strong revenue contribution from certain categories, with Furniture generating the majority of total profit at 985.36K (64.73%), followed by Office Supplies at 331.03K and Technology at 205.95K. Subcategory insight reveals key performers such as binders, paper, and furnishings, while the copier category operates at a loss of -16K, suggesting pricing issues, warranty expense, or high logistics overhead. Top individual products—including Eldon ClusterMat and Panasonic models—highlight a dependency on a small set of profitable SKUs, creating product concentration risk. Operational data further indicates significant shipping cost pressure due to reliance on air freight (nearly 90% of orders), which likely diminishes margins and limits scale efficiency. Seasonal fluctuations in profitability also suggest the need for improved forecasting, inventory planning, and promotional timing. Overall, strengthening the product portfolio through cost optimization, renegotiated vendor terms, improved shipping strategy, and a focus on high-margin categories represents a key opportunity to unlock higher profitability.

# Dashboard Reporting
The report demonstrates effective use of Power BI’s online data connectivity features. Online data sources could have been accessed through the Web connector in Power Query, enabling extraction from APIs, publicly available data portals, or structured web tables such as the World Bank datasets, United Nations population tables, or Pew Research data. Transformations would have included filtering, normalising values, and establishing data types suitable for calculations and modelling. Data relationships would then be maintained in a structured model, potentially using a star schema for clarity and efficiency. Measures and aggregations were likely written using DAX to compute totals, percentages, and growth indicators. Once published to Power BI Service, scheduled refresh functionality ensures that the report updates automatically in alignment with new data releases. The report is visually clear and logically structured. It progresses from historical context through present-day geographic distribution and finally into cultural demographic segmentation. The colour consistency, geographic mapping, clean labelling, and strong visual hierarchy contribute to professionalism and readability. The report format is scalable and capable of supporting additional views such as forecast projections, age structure analysis, or socio-economic overlays.

### [Project 5:PURE SIP'S BEVERSGES](https://github.com/akhimiejr/PureSip-Beverages)
PureSip Beverages is a growing beverage distribution company supplying popular brands such as Coke, Fanta, Sprite, and other leading soft drinks to major retailers including Costco, Walgreens, Target, and Walmart. As the organisation expanded, sales reporting became increasingly fragmented due to reliance on separate spreadsheets managed by regional managers. To address challenges related to data consolidation, reporting accuracy, and analytical capability, PureSip implemented a Power BI solution using a centralised folder connection and automated refresh, enabling real-time visibility of performance across all locations.

# Key Contributions

## 1. Centralised Data Management
PureSip Beverages implemented a robust shared folder structure accessible to all relevant stakeholders within the organisation. This centralised repository serves as the single source of truth for all regional sales data, replacing fragmented spreadsheets managed individually by regional managers. By consolidating all sales files into a unified, organised structure, the company eliminated duplication of effort, simplified data governance, and ensured that all teams work from consistent, up-to-date information.

## 2. Automated Data Refresh and Integration
Leveraging Power BI’s folder connection capability, the company automated the detection and integration of new sales spreadsheets as soon as they are uploaded to the shared folder. This automation removes the need for manual data consolidation, significantly reducing the time and effort required to prepare reports. The continuous, real-time data refresh ensures that decision-makers always have access to the most current information, enabling timely responses to market trends and sales opportunities.

## 3. Enhanced Data Accuracy and Consistency
By standardising the data collection process and automating integration, PureSip reduced errors arising from inconsistent spreadsheet formats, manual entry mistakes, and data duplication. This approach ensures high-quality, reliable data across all retailers and regions. Consistent data improves confidence in reports, reduces the risk of misinformed decisions, and allows management to track performance trends with greater accuracy.

## 4. Improved Reporting and Analytics Capability
The transition from static spreadsheets to Power BI enabled advanced reporting and analytical capabilities that were previously unattainable. The company can now leverage interactive dashboards, trend analysis, geographic visualisation, and performance comparisons across regions. These capabilities provide actionable insights into sales performance, help identify growth opportunities, and support strategic decision-making with clear, data-driven evidence.

## 5.Operational Efficiency and Scalability
Automating the data integration and reporting process freed staff from repetitive manual tasks such as consolidating spreadsheets and reconciling errors. This operational efficiency allows teams to focus on higher-value activities, such as analysing trends or developing sales strategies. Furthermore, the system is designed to scale easily: as PureSip expands to additional regions or retailers, the same folder structure and Power BI connection can accommodate new data without requiring structural changes, ensuring long-term sustainability of the reporting framework.

Pie chart showing the spend range and total fraudulent amount.

Our earlier analysis showed that the average amount spent on any transaction by a customer, 
either female or male was $71,  which is a characteristic of fraudulent transactions, the observation is that fraudulent transactions tend to be three times 
or higher the average spend of a customer. This makes sense as scammers would want to cash 
in big in order to get away with as much more as they can.
