# Projects

# https://github.com/akhimiejr/CRIME-ANALYSIS-REPORT-FROM

The project analyzes various crime types, such as violent and non-violent crimes, to understand their frequency, affected demographics, times of occurrence, and geographical distribution. Using **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **scikit-learn**, and **plotly**, the analysis employs machine learning models (**Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**) to predict crime likelihood and identify key contributing factors. The practical applications are significant, enabling **financial institutions** to prevent crime and allowing the **LAPD** to optimize patrols based on crime patterns. The study also integrates current crime detection and prevention methodologies, such as **statistical analysis**, **GIS for spatial insights**, and **real-time alert systems**, aiming to enhance **public safety** and **resource efficiency**.
##  Key Contributions
###  Model Development 
I designed and implemented machine learning models including **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest** to predict the likelihood of crimes based on time, location, and demographic information. I also developed a predictive service to support law enforcement agencies in proactive crime prevention and optimized resource deployment.
###  Crime Variable Description  
I analyzed a dataset of over **944,000 LAPD crime reports** and documented **28 key variables**, including crime types, victim demographics, weapon use, geographic data, and timestamps. This analysis was critical to understanding crime patterns and contextual factors.
###  Data Visualization  
Using libraries like **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly**, I created interactive and static visualizations to show crime trends over time, geographic concentrations, and demographic patterns. These visual tools helped uncover important insights and supported model development.
###  Statistical Modeling  
I conducted **correlation analysis** to explore relationships between variables such as time, location, and victim demographics. These statistical insights informed **feature selection** and improved the interpretability and performance of the machine learning models.
###  Data Cleaning  
I cleaned and preprocessed the raw crime data by handling missing values (e.g., coordinates like **(0¬∞, 0¬∞)**), fixing formatting issues, and removing inconsistencies. This ensured a clean, reliable dataset for accurate analysis and modeling.
