# Projects

# Projecct 1: CRIME ANALYSIS REPORT
# https://github.com/akhimiejr/CRIME-ANALYSIS-REPORT-FROM

The project analyzes various crime types, such as violent and non-violent crimes, to understand their frequency, affected demographics, times of occurrence, and geographical distribution. Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and plotly, the analysis employs machine learning models Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict crime likelihood and identify key contributing factors. The practical applications are significant, enabling financial institutions to prevent crime and allowing the LAPD to optimize patrols based on crime patterns. The study also integrates current crime detection and prevention methodologies, such as statistical analysis, GIS for spatial insights, and real-time alert systems, aiming to enhance public safety and resource efficiency.
##  Key Contributions
###  Model Development 
I designed and implemented machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict the likelihood of crimes based on time, location, and demographic information. I also developed a predictive service to support law enforcement agencies in proactive crime prevention and optimized resource deployment.
###  Crime Variable Description  
I analyzed a dataset of over 944,000 LAPD crime reports and documented 28 key variables, including crime types, victim demographics, weapon use, geographic data, and timestamps. This analysis was critical to understanding crime patterns and contextual factors.
###  Data Visualization  
Using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn and plotly, I created interactive and static visualizations to show crime trends over time, geographic concentrations, and demographic patterns. These visual tools helped uncover important insights and supported model development.
###  Statistical Modeling  
I conducted **correlation analysis** to explore relationships between variables such as time, location, and victim demographics. These statistical insights informed **feature selection** and improved the interpretability and performance of the machine learning models.
###  Data Cleaning  
I cleaned and preprocessed the raw crime data by handling missing values (e.g., coordinates like (0¬∞, 0¬∞)), fixing formatting issues, and removing inconsistencies. This ensured a clean, reliable dataset for accurate analysis and modeling.

# Project 2: Predictive Analysis of Neurological Disorder Susceptibility Pattern for Urban Elderly Population
# https://github.com/akhimiejr/PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-DEMENTIA

This study investigates dementia susceptibility among urban elderly populations, a group particularly vulnerable due to socio-environmental factors like stress, pollution, and lifestyle. Recognizing limitations in existing research‚Äîsuch as data diversity, model generalizability, and clinical integration‚Äîthe study employs advanced machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and neural networks to improve early detection and prediction accuracy. The research combines a literature review with analysis of demographic and health data from urban healthcare centers to identify key dementia risk factors.
## Project Aim and Objectives
The primary aim of this research project is to develop a robust predictive Magnetic Resonance Imaging model that can accurately identify and classify dementia in urban populations using advanced machine learning techniques. The study seeks to address the gaps in current dementia research by focusing on the unique environmental, social, and economic factors prevalent in urban settings, which may influence the onset and progression of dementia. To achieve this aim, the following objectives have been established
-	Develop a brain MRI-based model to classify dementia stages in urban populations, aiming to surpass the accuracy of generalized models. This will enhance early detection and targeted treatment for urban individuals.
- Identify urban-specific risk factors like pollution and social isolation that influence dementia onset and progression. Incorporate these factors into predictive models for better relevance and accuracy.
-	Investigate disparities in dementia care related to socio-economic status, ethnicity, and cultural factors in urban settings. Identify key factors to address inequities and improve care quality.
-	Create recommendations to enhance urban dementia care through early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and equitable access. Guide policymakers and healthcare providers with evidence-based strategies.
## Key contribution
This Project contributes significantly to public health by developing predictive models tailored to urban elderly populations, revealing key socio-economic and environmental risk factors for dementia. These insights can inform targeted public health policies, such as reducing pollution and improving mental health services. Clinically, the study enhances early detection and personalized care through predictive analytics, improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes. It also lays the groundwork for future research into the mechanisms of urban-related dementia risk and encourages the application of similar methods to other neurological disorders. Overall, the study offers actionable insights to better understand and address dementia in urban settings.

# Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection 
# https://github.com/akhimiejr/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Fraud is a pervasive issue that affects businesses across various industries, leading to 
significant financial losses and reputational damage. With the advent of digital transactions 
and e-commerce, the risk of fraud has escalated, necessitating robust fraud detection and 
prevention mechanisms. This study aims to leverage data analytics and historical transaction 
data to uncover insights and develop robust fraud prevention strategies and anomalies that 
can indicate fraudulent activities, thereby enabling organizations to take proactive measures 
to mitigate fraud risks.

 ## Aim and Objectives 
The primary aim of this Project is to analyse a credit card fraud dataset to the identify patterns 
and gain a comprehensive insight that can aid in the detection and prevention of fraudulent 
activities. This will assist the banking industry in making critical step by which their 
customers use their credit card for transactions.  
The transaction data set that is being explored will also assist the companies in exploring their 
customer spending habits, age groups that transact the most, time period where transactions 
occur, helping the company plan resource allocation there by optimising response time from 
their customer care departments. 
## Key Contributions 
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the fraud dataset to understand the nature and 
characteristics of the data. 
- Identify key factors and variables that contribute to the likelihood of fraudulent 
transactions. 
- Develop strategies and techniques for detecting and preventing fraud based on the insights 
gained from the analysis. 
- Compare the effectiveness and efficiency of SAS and Tableau in performing fraud 
analytics and data visualization.

 Box plot of age of customer by gender 
 
In the above figure, it is demostrated that on average the male customers are older than the 
female customer. With the female customer on average being in their forties and the male 
customers are in their fifties. This insight os quite significant as stakeholders in the 
customer experience team can use this detial and reach out to older customers especially, 
giving them training on how to spot fraudulent transactions there by curbing the risk of them 
falling victim to scam.

Pie chart showing the spend range and total fraudulent amount.

Our earlier analysis showed that the average amount spent on any transaction by a customer, 
either female or male was $71,  which is a characteristic of fraudulent transactions, the observation is that fraudulent transactions tend to be three times 
or higher the average spend of a customer. This makes sense as scammers would want to cash 
in big in order to get away with as much more as they can.
